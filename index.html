        <h1>What's an Ukagaka/ghost and how do I install it?</h1>
        <p>An Ukagaka is a character that sits on your desktop and keeps you company. You'll need a program to run it. Zilch is made to run on SSP for Windows.</p>
        <p><a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">SSP</a> -choose 'complete install package'. Windows might try to block the installer since it's an executable. You can allow it to run by choosing 'more info'. Once you've installed SSP, run ssp.exe from it's folder.</p> 
		<p>When you run SSP for the first time, the default character will appear- Emily the catgirl! She'll speak in Japanese. Wait for her to finish her introduction (she'll open the preferences window).</p>
		<p>Now you'll want to install Zilch's files by dragging and dropping them on her. Zilch uses z_undertale balloon by Zarla- you should install the balloon first. Then, install Zilch's .nar file. Once Emily's done, right click her to change ghost.</p>
		<p>If you've installed the .nar first instead- a balloon folder would be created, but the files we need wouldn't be in it! So install the balloon and when asked whether to overwrite choose yes.</p>
		<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <li><p>An error window in Japanese appears when starting SSP:</p>
		<p>Drop the .nar file onto that window. If that doesn't work, click the first button and point it towards your ghost directory(something like \SSP\ghost). The second button is for the balloons- point it to \SSP\balloon.</p></li>
		<li><p>The right click menu is in Japanese:</p>
		<p>The language option is the 4th one up from the bottom. Select English and restart SSP.</p></li>		
		<li><p>The catgirl won't install the ghost for you:</p> 
		<p>First, unzip the z_undertale balloon to get the folder 'z_undertale'. Paste it into the \SSP\balloon folder next to emily's folder.</p> 	<p>Then, unzip the .nar file to get the folder 'ds_zilch' containing the subfolders 'ghost' and 'shell' plus some other files. Paste the 'ds_zilch' folder into the \SSP\ghost folder next to emily's folder.</p> 
		<p>Restart SSP and check the right click menu again.</p></li>
		<h1>How to use a ghost</h1>
		<li><p>Right clicking a ghost brings the SSP menu- you can switch between ghosts or call other ghosts from there. You can also check for updates, change scaling, or change preferences through 'options'.</p></li>
		<li><p>Double clicking a ghost's body brings their own menu for you to interact with them.</p></li>
		<li><p>Usually, you can pet a ghost by moving your cursor over their head, or hit them by double-clicking their face.</p></li> 
		<li><p>Undoubtedly, you'll make the correct decision.</p></li>
