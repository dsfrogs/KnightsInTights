//Change ghost's clock: ctrl+shift+T + Hook Current Time API

//Passivemode: balloons won't disappear, choices won't time out, ghost won't talk randomly, CAN double click/ move over mouse.
//you CAN call other ghosts, but no changing into other ghosts
//script testing possible and will get you out of passive mode 
//Remember to leave it or ghost is stuck (can reset passive mode from ghost menu)

//Close dialogue must end with \- instead of \e. \- will close the program.

//OnFunctions Can be called from anywhere in any .dic file by using \![raise]. Other functions can only be called within that .file. 

// ![raise,InsertFunctionName] can be used at the end of any piece of dialogue to call any function. useful for testing 

//can't use Script Input or raise to test  OnFirstBoot- can use test variables: paste dialogue/choices only and not values. delete when done testing

//Choices for a menu that'll only be used once: better to use Select.choice than starting all functions with On

// -- loads up the next function in the sequence. You can use this method to set many values at once, then go to the same function afterwords.

//Dialouge can be customised for times, dates, days... by using variables: hour,month, day 

//\![*]\q[Displayed Name,linkedfunction]. \![*] balloon's option icon, \q sets up the choice, Displayed Name the text to be displayed, linkedfunction, is what the choice is linked to when the user clicks it. 

//The body for select.options is often just a call to another function. Any function preceded with Select can only be called within its own file.

//To link to a function from another .dic file, it needs to be a stand-alone fucntion

//As a rule any complicated stuff should go in its own function, and be called by Select.option

//Simple dialogue responses to a choice can stay inside a Select.option 

// \![open,inputbox,OnUserBornMonth,-1]\e"
//opens input box and calls to function OnUserBornMonth with input month, -1 means no timeout

//s[-1] to make ghost disappear

//\c to clear balloon

//\x pause for user's input


//\![quicksection,1] \![quicksection,0] text appears instantly- turn on/off

//Test your dialogue with test variable function or with Script Input
//test functions by adding \![raise,function]
//or mode settings, item values, functions, raising or lowering numbers
//Especially dialogue/choices from OnFirstBoot can't be tested via script input

//%screenwidthx%screenheight to get user's  resolution

//Chains set up the next line for the character, it won't display it immediately (altalk)
