//-------------------------------------OTHER-IDEAS-----------------------------------------//

//At ending maybe let people move text blocks in their pace? not sure if that's a good idea...

//talk about- Home, Brother & science tend to get stuck grey ---> More Exp????

//put last chosen dialogue into lastTalk so 'repeat' plays it and not just randomTalk

//\s[0]\i[10] I can see the arms and legs disappear :[

//prevent people from spamming pet or give candy when Z is upset? or just repeating an action rapidly?

//Harmonica: volume

//draw dinosaurs on a bus
